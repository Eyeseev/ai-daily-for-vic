During its big GPT-5 livestream on Thursday, OpenAI showed off a few charts that made the model seem quite impressive — but if you look closely, some graphs were a little bit off. In one, ironically showing how well GPT-5 does in “deception evals across models,” the scale is all over the place. For “coding deception,” for example, the chart shown onstage says GPT-5 with thinking apparently gets a 50.0 percent deception rate, but that’s compared to OpenAI’s smaller 47.4 percent o3 score which somehow has a larger bar. OpenAI appears to have accurate numbers for this chart in its GPT-5 blog post, however, where GPT-5’s deception rate is labeled as 16.5 percent. who's making these graphs pic.twitter.com/Zt6yhZuUoo — Shrey Kothari (@shreyk0) August 7, 2025 With this chart, OpenAI showed onstage that one of GPT-5’s scores is lower than o3’s but is shown with a bigger bar. In this same chart, o3 and GPT-4o’s scores are different but shown with equally-sized bars. It was bad enough that CEO Sam Altman commented on it, calling it a “mega chart screwup,” though he noted that a correct version is in OpenAI’s blog post. An OpenAI marketing staffer also apologized, saying, “We fixed the chart in the blog guys, apologies for the unintentional chart crime.” this screenshot from GPT-5 livestream has to be among the worst chart crimes of the century pic.twitter.com/HXsK2CWCon — Ege Erdil (@EgeErdil2) August 7, 2025 OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

People who use Dia for free will still have access to the same features the browser launched with, including the ability to interact with the browser’s AI chatbot and create custom skills. But free users might run into some limits if they frequently use Dia’s AI chat feature. The Browser Company hasn’t carved out specific limits for non-subscribers, but CEO Josh Miller told The New York Times last month that “the browser will remain free for those who use the A.I. tool only a few times a week.” Miller also hinted at rolling out additional subscription tiers, ranging from $5 to hundreds of dollars per month. The Browser Company first announced the development of Dia late last year before launching it in beta in June. Over the past several months, Google and Microsoft have begun knitting AI more tightly into their browsers, while the AI search startup Perplexity has released an early access version of its AI browser Comet.

      "title": "The 6 biggest changes coming to ChatGPT",
      "source": "The Verge – AI",
      "summary": "GPT-5 has finally arrived. Along with the announcement of the highly anticipated AI model, OpenAI also previewed several updates coming to ChatGPT, ranging from visual changes to improvements to the chatbot’s performance. Here’s a rundown of all of the changes you can expect to see in ChatGPT. Say goodbye to the model picker With the rollout of GPT-5, OpenAI is getting rid of the model picker and retiring many of its older models, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and GPT-4.5. ChatGPT now runs on GPT-5 by default, and has a “single auto-switching system” that combines its previous models into a “faster, smarter model,” theoretically eliminating the need to swap between models for different purposes. However, ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users can still use a model picker that allows them to switch between GPT-5 or GPT-5 Thinking. Pro and Team users will also get access to GPT-Thinking Pro. OpenAI gives ChatGPT “personalities” One of the biggest updates coming to ChatGPT is the ability to select from four new “personalities” for text-based responses. Here’s how OpenAI describes each of them: Cynic: Sarcastic and dry, delivers blunt help with wit. Often teases, but provides direct, practical answers when it matters. Robot: Precise, efficient, and emotionless, delivering direct answers without extra words. Listener: Warm and laid-back, reflecting your thoughts back with calm clarity and light wit. Nerd: Playful and curious, explaining concepts clearly while celebrating knowledge and discovery. These new personalities sound like they might be fun to play around with. But if you’re not a fan, you can always switch back to ChatGPT’s “default” style. Better vibe coding capabilities Vibe coding, or the process of having AI generate code based on natural language prompts, just got an upgrade on ChatGPT. OpenAI says GPT-5 is even better at processing complex and descriptive prompts when asking it to create an app or website. You can then see — and interact — with a preview of what the AI chatbot has built by opening Canvas. More app customization OpenAI is rolling out new ways to customize ChatGPT’s interface. With this update, you can set an accent color that will change the appearance of your conversation bubbles, voice button, and highlighted text. To do this on the web, click your profile icon, select Settings > General. From there, select an option from within the Accent color drop-down. You can do the same thing on mobile by tapping your profile picture, heading to Personalization, and tapping Color Scheme. Advanced voice mode can “adapt” to you ChatGPT’s advanced voice mode, which allows for more natural-sounding spoken conversations, is getting an update for paid users that will make it better at understanding instructions, as well as allow subscribers to tweak its speaking style. OpenAI also announced that it’s retiring standard voice mode, but it’s offering “near-unlimited” use of advanced voice mode for paid users, and bringing “hours” of extra usage to free users in exchange. Advanced voice mode now works with custom GPTs, too. Easily connect your Gmail and Google Calendar Lastly, OpenAI is making it easier to link your Gmail account and Google Calendar to ChatGPT. As explained in a demo, ChatGPT will now ask you to connect your Gmail or Calendar when you enter a prompt, such as “help me plan my schedule tomorrow.” Once you link your account, ChatGPT will draw from your schedule and your emails to plan out your day, notify you about missed emails, and more. The ability to connect these accounts is coming to Pro users next week, “with other tiers coming next.”",

      "description": "Is that a back penis? While Microsoft was busy updating Copilot yesterday with OpenAI's new GPT-5 model, it also quietly launched Copilot 3D. It's a free-to-use feature that can transform a regular 2D image into a 3D model that can then be used in game creation, animation, 3D printing, VR / AR, and much more. Copilot 3D just needs a good clean 2D image, and you don't even need to use any text prompts. Microsoft recommends using images with a clear background or a strong separation between the subject and the background. I've been testing Copilot 3D today and found that it works better when an image has even lighting and a sense of depth, to help the AI model bet … Read the full story at The Verge.",

      "description": "Something’s off with that chart on the left. During its big GPT-5 livestream on Thursday, OpenAI showed off a few charts that made the model seem quite impressive — but if you look closely, some graphs were a little bit off. In one, ironically showing how well GPT-5 does in “deception evals across models,” the scale is all over the place. For “coding deception,” for example, the chart shown onstage says GPT-5 with thinking apparently gets a 50.0 percent deception rate, but that’s compared to OpenAI’s smaller 47.4 percent o3 score which somehow has a larger bar. OpenAI appears to have accurate numbers for this chart in its GPT-5 blog post, however, where GPT-5’s deception rate is labeled as 16.5 percent. who's making these graphs pic.twitter.com/Zt6yhZuUoo — Shrey Kothari (@shreyk0) August 7, 2025 With this chart, OpenAI showed onstage that one of GPT-5’s scores is lower than o3’s but is shown with a bigger bar. In this same chart, o3 and GPT-4o’s scores are different but shown with equally-sized bars. It was bad enough that CEO Sam Altman commented on it, calling it a “mega chart screwup,” though he noted that a correct version is in OpenAI’s blog post. An OpenAI marketing staffer also apologized, saying, “We fixed the chart in the blog guys, apologies for the unintentional chart crime.” this screenshot from GPT-5 livestream has to be among the worst chart crimes of the century pic.twitter.com/HXsK2CWCon — Ege Erdil (@EgeErdil2) August 7, 2025 OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. And while it’s unclear if OpenAI used GPT-5 to actually make the charts, it’s still not a great look for the company on its big launch day — especially when it is touting the “significant advances in reducing hallucinations” with its new model.",
